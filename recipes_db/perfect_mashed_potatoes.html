<h2>Note</h2>
<p>Always put potatoes in cold water to start, then bring to a boil. That way the potatoes cook more. <br>

<h2>Ingredients</h2>

<ul>
    <li>1 1/2 pounds (680 g) Yukon Gold potatoes, peeled and cut into roughly 1 1/2-inch cubes</li>    
    <li>1 teaspoon salt, divided</li>
    <li>4 tablespoons (60 ml) heavy cream</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons (30 g) butter</li>
    <li>1-4 tablespoons milk, as needed</li>
    <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
</ul>

<h2>Method</h2>

<ol>
    <li><strong>Cook the potatoes:</strong> <br>
        Place the peeled and cut potatoes into a medium saucepan. Add cold water to the pan until the potatoes are covered by at least
        1 inch. Add 1/2 teaspoon of salt to the water. <br>
        Turn the heat to high and bring the water to a boil. Reduce the heat to low to maintain a simmer, and cover. Cook for 15 to 20
        minutes, or until you can easily poke through the potatoes with a fork.</li>
        <li><strong>Heat the butter and cream:</strong> <br>
            While the potatoes are cooking, melt the butter and warm the cream together in a pan on the stove or in the microwave.</li>
            <li><strong>Drain and mash the potatoes:</strong> <br>
                When the potatoes are done, drain the water and place the steaming hot potatoes into a large bowl. Pour the heated cream and
                melted butter over the potatoes, along with the remaining 1/2 teaspoon salt. <br>
                Mash the potatoes with a potato masher. Then use a strong wooden spoon (a metal spoon might bend) to beat further. <br>
                Add milk and beat until the mashed potatoes are smooth. Don't over-beat the potatoes or the mashed potatoes will end up gluey. <br>
                Taste, then season as needed with salt and pepper.</li>
        </ol>
