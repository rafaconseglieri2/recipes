        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 pound crusty bread, torn or cut into 1/2-inch cubes</li>
            <li>1 1/2 cups chicken broth</li>
            <li>1 cup (2 sticks) unsalted butter, melted</li>
            <li>2 cups Quick Kimchi or store-bought kimchi (including juices), chopped</li>
            <li>2 medium yellow onions, small diced</li>
            <li>4 stalks celery, small diced</li>
            <li>1 cup English or black walnuts, rough chopped</li>
            <li>4 cloves garlic, minced</li>
            <li>1/2 cup fresh parsley leaves, chopped</li>
            <li>1/4 cup fresh sage leaves, chopped</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons fresh rosemary, finely chopped</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons fresh thyme leaves</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil</li>            
        </ul>
        <h2>Method</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Cook the potatoes:</strong><br>
                Place the peeled and cut potatoes into a medium saucepan. Add cold water to the pan until the potatoes are covered by at least 1 inch. Add 1/2 teaspoon of salt to the water. <br>
                Turn the heat to high and bring the water to a boil. Reduce the heat to low to maintain a simmer, and cover. Cook for 15 to 20 minutes, or until you can easily poke through the potatoes with a fork.</li>
            <li><strong>Heat the butter and cream:</strong><br>
                While the potatoes are cooking, melt the butter and warm the cream together in a pan on the stove or in the microwave.</li>
            <li><strong>Drain and mash the potatoes:</strong><br>
                When the potatoes are done, drain the water and place the steaming hot potatoes into a large bowl. Pour the heated cream and melted butter over the potatoes, along with the remaining 1/2 teaspoon salt.<br>
                Mash the potatoes with a potato masher. Then use a strong wooden spoon (a metal spoon might bend) to beat further.<br>
                Add milk and beat until the mashed potatoes are smooth. Don't over-beat the potatoes or the mashed potatoes will end up gluey.<br>
                Taste, then season as needed with salt and pepper.</li>
        </ol>
