        <h2>Note</h2>
        <p>Handle raw turkey the way you would raw chicken, with care. Use a separate cutting board and utensils to avoid contaminating other foods. <br>
            Wash your hands with soap and water after touching raw turkey and before you touch anything else in the kitchen. Wipe down surfaces with
            dampened paper towels. <br>
            Need help figuring out how big a turkey to get? Butterball has a turkey calculator that helps you figure out just how many pounds you need
            per person.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 turkey, approximately 15 pounds (see Recipe Note)</li>
            <li>Juice of 1 lemon</li>
            <li>Salt and pepper, to taste</li>
            <li>Extra virgin olive oil, or softened/melted butter</li>
            <li>1/2 medium onion, peeled and quartered</li>
            <li>1 medium rib celery</li>
            <li>1 to 2 carrots</li>
            <li>1 bunch fresh parsley</li>
            <li>Several sprigs fresh rosemary, sage, and/or thyme</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Method</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Defrost the turkey several days ahead:</strong><br>
                If you are starting with a frozen turkey, you will need to allow several days to defrost the turkey. You'll want to defrost it in the
                refrigerator so that the turkey stays chilled during this process. <br>
                Put the wrapped frozen turkey in a pan to prevent leaks and then place it in the refrigerator. It will take about 5 hours of
                defrosting time for every pound of turkey. So, if you have a 15 pound turkey, it should take about 75 hours, or 3 days, to defrost. <br>
                If you need to defrost it more quickly than that, you can place it in a large tub of cool water, and keep changing the water to keep
                it cold, until the turkey is defrosted.</li>
            <li><strong>Bring the turkey to room temperature before roasting:</strong><br>
                Remove the turkey from the refrigerator 2 to 5 hours (depending on the size of the bird) before cooking, to allow it to come closer
                to room temperature. The turkey will cook more quickly and more evenly that way.</li>
            <li><strong>Remove giblets and rinse:</strong><br>
                When you are ready to cook the turkey, remove it from its package. Usually turkeys come packaged with the neck and giblets
                (heart, gizzard, liver) in the main cavity or the neck opening (make sure to check both!) <br>
                Pull the giblets out; they are often wrapped in a small paper package. <br>
                If you want, you can chop up the heart and gizzard to make stock for the stuffing or dressing (put the chopped heart and gizzard
                into a small saucepan, cover with water, add salt, bring to simmer for an hour or so.) <br>
                You can either cook the neck alongside the turkey, or use it to make turkey stock. You can also use all of the giblets for making
                giblet gravy. <br>
                Rinse the turkey inside and out with water. If you see stray turkey feathers, pluck them out. Use paper towels to pat the turkey
                dry. <br>
                Many turkeys come with a plastic tie holding the drumsticks together. Check the instructions on the turkey package; it is likely
                that you will not need to remove the tie unless you are cooking the turkey at a very high temperature.</li>
            <li><strong>Preheat the oven:</strong><br>
                Turn your oven to 400°F.</li>
            <li><strong>Add the aromatics and truss the turkey:</strong><br>
                Slather the inside of the cavity with a tablespoon or so of lemon juice. Take a couple teaspoons of salt and rub all over the
                inside of the turkey. (Skip the salt if you are using a brined turkey.) <br>
                Put the cut onion, several sprigs of parsley, a chopped carrot or two, and some leafy celery tops into the main cavity of the
                turkey. These are aromatics that will flavor the turkey from the inside as it cooks. <br>
                Cover the entrance to the main cavity with aluminum foil, or close it with metal skewers or kitchen string (not nylon string!), so
                that the aromatics don't fall out while you are roasting the turkey. <br>
                Put a few sprigs of parsley into the neck opening, cover the opening with the surrounding turkey skin, and close the opening with
                skewers or string. <br>
                By the way, we don't cook stuffing (or dressing as it is known in many parts of the country) in the turkey anymore. Stuffing the
                turkey adds to the overall cooking time. Not packing the turkey with stuffing will allow the turkey to cook more evenly. We do
                make our stuffing with stock made from the turkey giblets so the stuffing has plenty of turkey flavor. <br>
                We truss our turkey, though some people choose not too. The point of trussing is to keep the legs and wings close to the body so
                they don't spread out while cooking. <br>
                To truss, make sure that the turkey's legs are tied together, held close to the body, and tie a string around the turkey body to hold
                the wings in close. (Here's a good video: how to truss a turkey.)</li>
            <li><strong>Season the outside of the turkey:</strong><br>
                Rub either softened butter or extra virgin olive oil all over the outside of the turkey. Sprinkle salt generously on all sides of the
                outside of the turkey (do not add salt if you are using a brined turkey). Sprinkle black pepper over the turkey as well.</li>
            <li><strong>Place turkey breast side down on the rack:</strong><br>
                Place the turkey BREAST DOWN on a rack over a sturdy roasting pan big enough to catch all the drippings. <br>
                How do you know the turkey is breast side down? The wings are up and the legs are down. <br>
                Note that you can also place the turkey directly on an oven rack with a large roasting pan to catch the drippings on the rack
                below. That method helps create a convection-like environment, helping the heat circulate more evenly around the turkey. <br>
                Add several sprigs of fresh thyme, sage, and/or rosemary to the outside of the turkey or tucked under the wings. <br>
                <strong>SimpleTip!</strong><br>
                If you are using a remote thermometer (or two) to gauge the temperature of the turkey while it cooks, it's easiest to find the
                right place to insert the probe when the turkey is breast side UP. So eyeball where you think the thermometer probe(s) should
                go first, before placing the turkey breast side down in the pan. Once the turkey is breast side down in the pan, insert the
                probes into the thickest and coldest parts of the breast and/or thighs, making sure the probe is not touching the metal rack or
                pan. If you only have one remote thermometer, put it in the breast.</li>
            <li><strong>Roast the turkey:</strong><br>
                Before you put the turkey in the oven, do a rough calculation of how much overall time it should take to cook the turkey. Usually
                they say to assume 15 minutes for every pound of meat, but I have found in practice that it's usually less than that, more like 13
                minutes per pound. <br>
                Cooking time will vary depending on the size of the turkey, how long it has been sitting at room temperature before cooking, and
                the shape and particulars of your specific oven. So come up with a rough estimate for the overall cooking time, and then make
                sure to check how the turkey is doing well before it is supposed to be done! <br>
                Put the turkey in the oven at 400°F, uncovered. For the 15 lb turkey, start the cooking at 400°F for the first 20 minutes to brown it.
                Then reduce the heat to 325°F for the next 1 to 2 hours, until the internal temperature of the breast reaches about 140°F to
                145°F or so. Then reduce the heat further to 225°F until done, anywhere from a half hour to an hour or more. <br>
                <strong>SimpleTip!</strong><br>
                Note that the lower oven temperature at the end of cooking can help you time when you want the turkey to be done. If the
turkey is cooking more quickly than you expect, lowering the oven temp can extend the cooking time. If the turkey isn't cooking
quickly enough and you're ready to eat, don't lower the temperature to 225°F, or if you already have, increase it again to
325°F.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Brown the breast (optional):</strong><br>
            If you want the turkey skin of the breast to be browned, when the turkey is close to being done (about 150°F for the breast), you'll
            need to turn the turkey over so that the breast is on top, and put it in a 500°F oven or under the broiler for 4 to 5 minutes, just
            enough time to brown the breast. <br>
            Note that by browning the breast you may end up over-cooking the turkey breast a little bit. We often don't turn the turkey over.
            Turning the turkey over can be a hot, messy job, so if you do it, the best way is to use clean oven mitts or clean kitchen towels
            (just throw them in the laundry afterwards.)</li>
            <li><strong>Check the turkey to be sure it's done:</strong><br>
                Start taking temperature readings with a meat thermometer, inserted deep into the thickest part of the turkey breast and thigh, an
                hour and a half before the turkey should be done. <br>
                You want a resulting temperature of 165°F for the white meat (breast) and 165°F to 170°F for the dark meat (thighs and legs).
                The temperature of the bird will continue to rise once you take it out of the oven, so <strong> take the turkey out of the oven when the
                temperature reading for the breast is 155°F to 160°F, and for the thigh is 160°F to 165°F.</strong> If you don't have a meat
                thermometer, spear the breast with a knife. The turkey juices should be clear, not pink. <br>
                If the thighs reach their target temperature before the breast, turn the turkey over and let the turkey finish cooking, breast side
                up.</li>
            <li><strong>Rest the turkey and carve:</strong><br>
                Once you remove the turkey from the oven, transfer it to a cutting board, tent it with aluminum foil to keep it warm, and let it rest
                for 15 to 30 minutes, depending on the size of the turkey. Turn the turkey breast side up to carve it.</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Making Turkey Gravy</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Make a roux with the turkey fat:</strong><br>
                Use a metal spoon to ladle off some of the excess fat from the pan (leave about 4 tablespoon or so of fat and drippings in the
                pan) and reserve for another use. <br>
                You can use either flour or cornstarch to make the gravy. (We find we get better results with flour. So, we recommend making the
                gravy with flour unless serving a guest who must eat gluten-free.) <br>
                If using flour, heat the fat and drippings in the pan until they are bubbly. Sprinkle 1/4 cup of flour all over the fat and drippings. <br>
                Stir with a wire whisk to make a roux with the flour and fat. Let the flour brown a minute or so in the hot pan.</li>
            <li><strong>Add liquid to make the gravy:</strong><br>
                Slowly add 3 cups of water, stock, or milk to the pan, whisking vigorously to get rid of any lumps. Let the gravy simmer and
                thicken. <br>
                Add salt and pepper, ground sage, thyme or other seasonings to taste. <br>
                See our gravy recipe for more detailed instructions and on making gravy using cornstarch.</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Save Bones for Stock</h3>
        <p>When you are finished with your turkey, save the bones from the carcass to make a delicious turkey soup.</p>
